### **What is L2 Norm?**
The **L2 norm**, also known as the **Euclidean norm**, is a way of measuring the **length** or **magnitude** of a vector in Euclidean space. It's essentially the straight-line distance from the origin to a point in space, which in this case is defined by the vector.

Think of a vector as a line pointing from the origin (0,0,...0) in a multi-dimensional space to some point. The **L2 norm** measures how long this line is.

#### **Formula for L2 Norm**:
The formula for the **L2 norm** is:
\[
\| \mathbf{v} \|_2 = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \dots + v_n^2}
\]
Where:
- \( \mathbf{v} \) is the vector, and
- \( v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n \) are the components (values) of the vector.

This formula means you:
1. Square each component of the vector.
2. Sum those squares.
3. Take the square root of the sum.

### **Geometric Intuition (Distance in Space)**
In **two-dimensional space**, imagine you have a vector \( \mathbf{v} \) that points from the origin (0,0) to a point (x, y). The **L2 norm** of this vector is simply the length of the line from (0,0) to (x,y), which is the same as using the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance:
\[
\text{L2 norm} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
In **three-dimensional space**, the formula would be:
\[
\text{L2 norm} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]
For **n-dimensional space**, you just extend this idea by including more terms, but it’s still just the distance in multi-dimensional space.

### **Why is the L2 Norm Useful?**

In contexts like **vector space models** (such as **TF-IDF**), the L2 norm is used to measure the **magnitude** of the vector. This is important because:
- **Normalization**: It helps **normalize** the vector so that vectors of different magnitudes (like short or long documents) are comparable. 
  - After calculating the L2 norm of a vector, you divide each of the vector's components by this norm. This transforms the vector into a **unit vector**, meaning its length is now **1**, but it still points in the same direction.
  - This ensures that we focus on the relative proportions or **directions** of the vectors, not their absolute lengths (important for ranking retrieval results in information retrieval).
  
#### Example: 
Imagine you have a vector representing a document:
\[
\mathbf{v} = [2, 3, 6]
\]
This vector has three components. The **L2 norm** would be:
\[
\| \mathbf{v} \|_2 = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]
Now, to **normalize** the vector, you divide each component by the L2 norm (which is 7):
\[
\mathbf{v}_{\text{normalized}} = \left[\frac{2}{7}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{6}{7}\right] \approx [0.29, 0.43, 0.86]
\]
The vector's direction is the same, but its length (magnitude) is now 1. This makes comparisons between vectors fairer when comparing documents or queries of different lengths.

### **Why Normalize?**
When you normalize using the L2 norm, the components of the vector get scaled down, but the **ratios** between them stay the same. This way, the vector is comparable to other vectors, even if they originally had different lengths. This is critical when comparing documents of different lengths in information retrieval tasks like **TF-IDF**.

### **Relation to Making Values Fall into a Range**
You mentioned that L2 normalization makes numbers fall into a certain range. That’s right—after normalization, the components of the vector lie between 0 and 1, or between -1 and 1 if negative values are present. The entire vector itself will have a **length (magnitude)** of 1 after normalization.

### **Summary**:
- **L2 norm** (Euclidean norm) measures the **magnitude (length)** of a vector.
- It's calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the vector's components.
- **Normalization** using L2 norm scales the vector so that its length is 1, but the relative proportions of its components are preserved.
- This process ensures fair comparison between vectors, especially when their original lengths differ, like in document comparison in **TF-IDF** or other ranking systems.

By normalizing vectors, we focus on the **direction** of the vector, not its absolute size, which is crucial for comparing the relevance of documents in information retrieval systems.
